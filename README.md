# Carbon Icon Animations

This is a package of animated icons which mirrors the icons in [Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/icons/library/) icons.
It enables developers to import an animated icon directly from this library, in place of importing the existing static icon from the Carbon Design System library. The animated icons are implemented as React components.  Since they do not make use of Carbon's icon components directly, they are not tied to a specific version of Carbon, and can be used in any React project.  

Check out what the animations look like in this [example app](https://carbon-design-system.github.io/icons-motion/).

We will be adding onto this library one category at a time - the current release includes the **Navigation** icons, and the next batch will be the **Operations** icons (currently in progress).  
If you want to request an icon/category to be animated, please open an issue using the **New icon animation** template.  Working together with the Carbon team, we will prioritize the categories that will be most frequently used. 

We will do our very best to keep these icons in sync with the Carbon icons but if there is a change to the Carbon icon, it may not yet be reflected in our library- if you encounter this, please open a **Update icon animation** issue to alert us.

## Using the icons

### Installation
To use the icons in your project, first install the package: 

```bash
npm install icons-motion
```

### Usage

Next, import and use the icon component and CSS file from the package. Example:

```jsx
import HomeMotion from 'icons-motion'
import 'carbon-motion/dist/index.css'

const myComponent = () => {
  <HomeMotion 
    isAnimating={false}
    size={32}
  />
}
```

The component takes two props:
- `isAnimating` is a boolean; to trigger the animation, change this prop to `true`
- `size` is an integer which will set the width and height of the icon in px
